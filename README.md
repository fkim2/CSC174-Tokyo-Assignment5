#### Ontology
The topic chosen concerned pollution of oceans, the problem behind it, its causes, and prevention. Throughout the website pages, HTML structural tags were utilized to clearly present the topic and many h3 tags identified and categorized the information. Information was presented in paragraph or list item form to add variation as well and be more inviting for the reader. 

#### Choreography 
The webpages were organized in a manner that presented the information logically. The index page defined what the problem was by defining pollution and the importance of ocean reservoirs. The other pages, as seen via the nav bar, then go further into the causes/types of pollution, the impacts (page also goes into prevention), and a survey form. Through this chosen choreography, the information was depicted in an organized, logical manner that the reader can easily follow. 


#### Intended Layout/Mood/Feeling
The topic of pollution is serious so the typeface choices and color choices should also reflect that. However, there is still the message of hope from the preventative efforts also discussed so that tone may also be reflected. 

#### Intended Interactivity  
Comments were added to the survey webpage for the coder to see what kind of question input seemed appropriate. These answers would then be recorded in the database to be referred to later. The login system can be flexible in what information it takes (username, password, etc).
