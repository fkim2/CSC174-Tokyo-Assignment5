## Colophon
### IA 

#### Ontology
The topic chosen concerned pollution of oceans, the problem behind it, its causes, and prevention. Throughout the website pages, HTML structural tags were utilized to clearly present the topic and many h3 tags identified and categorized the information. Information was presented in paragraph or list item form to add variation as well and be more inviting for the reader. 

#### Choreography 
The webpages were organized in a manner that presented the information logically. The index page defined what the problem was by defining pollution and the importance of ocean reservoirs. The other pages, as seen via the nav bar, then go further into the causes/types of pollution, the impacts (page also goes into prevention), and a survey form. Through this chosen choreography, the information was depicted in an organized, logical manner that the reader can easily follow. 


#### Intended Layout/Mood/Feeling
The topic of pollution is serious so the typeface choices and color choices should also reflect that. However, there is still the message of hope from the preventative efforts also discussed so that tone may also be reflected. 

#### Intended Interactivity  
Comments were added to the survey webpage for the coder to see what kind of question input seemed appropriate. These answers would then be recorded in the database to be referred to later. The login system can be flexible in what information it takes (username, password, etc). 

### Designer

#### Layouts
Layouts were executed based on the input of the IA - a Z-Pattern home page and F-Patterns on content pages. Instructions provided by IA were followed and creative liberties were taken where there was no instruction.

The fonts Lobster was used for headings for it's flowing design (much like and ocean). Raleway was used for all content beacause it is both highly readable and legiable, in addition to pairing well with Lobster. The color palette was based off a photo provided on the pollution page, so all the colors pull together into one coherent theme. The consistant nav bar and color palette helps make the website look unified. 

C.R.A.P. Principles:
	Contrast: Contrast was mainly achieved on this webpage throught the color palettes used. The combination of light and dark tones helped create content that 'pops'. Additionally, containers were framed with box shadows. 
	Repetition: Repetition can be seen with the consistancy of container styles and fonts, in addition to the cary through of nav and style elements.
	Alignment: Alignment is also seen through the containers and how the content on each page is visually organized, related topics are closer together.
	Proximity: Once again, promixity is done by grouping like content into containers, which are clearly visually separated on the page. 


#### Notes

W3 CSS was used as a framework for nav components instead of bootstrap.

EXTRA: Dynamic background created with https://www.gradient-animator.com/ in order to simulate waves

Please note: at the time of this posting, the login attributes are not complete due to technical difficulites the coder was experiencing. Attributes will be added once they are posted.
